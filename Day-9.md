Today we learn to perform risk assessment in compliance with `GRC`. Risk assessments are like reality checks for businesses they minimize business risk in the long run. Businesses need to perform these assessments in order to minimize revenue and reputation loss resulting from a cyber threat which can be eliminated if one performs these assessments.

Firstly in order to quantify `risk` we need to identify how likely or probable it is that the risk will materialise after which we assign a number  1 through 5 to quantify this likelihood.
```
Improbable: So unlikely that it might never happen.
Remote: Very unlikely to happen, but still, there is a possibility.
Occasional: Likely to happen once/sometime.
Probable: Likely to happen several times.
Frequent: Likely to happen often and regularly.
```
Now once we have identified the risks and the likelihood of a risk, the next step is to quantify the impact this risk's materialisation might have on the organisation. Similar to likelihood, we also quantify impact, often on a scale of 1 to 5.
```
Informational: Very low impact, almost non-existent.
Low: Impacting a limited part of one area of the organisation's operations, with little to no revenue loss.
Medium: Impacting one part of the organisation's operations completely, with major revenue loss.
High: Impacting several parts of the organisation's operations, causing significant revenue loss
Critical: Posing an existential threat to the organisation.
```
We are now navigated to site where three vendors have filled out a questionaire and it is now our job to perform risk assessment and identify the vendor with the least risk assosciated with them

Following are my assessments for the three vendors in order:

Vendor 1:

Vendor 2:

Vendor 3:

Now we can see that `Risk Score` which is the multiplication of `Likelihood` and `Impact` is the least for the first vendor. Choosing the first vendor gives us our required flag.
