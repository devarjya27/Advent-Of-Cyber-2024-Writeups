Today we get to know about `websockets` and the difference between `http` and `websockets`. Additionaly we are asked to exploit the vulnerabilities that arise in a `websocket` connection.

If we were to send a `http` request to a server to recieve certain data, once we recieve that data the connection would be closed. For instance if we want constant updatesfrom the server then a `http` connection is not really efficient as we would need to make new requests everytime we wanted an update. That's where `websocket` comes in, it is like an open door. Once we start a `websocket` connection it stays open allowing for efficient transfer of data. But this poses certain vulnerabilities. Hackers can manipulate the data or messages on a `websocket` connection and as everything is instantaneously happening in this connection there willl be no time for the user or the server to verify these data or messages.

So opening the webpage, burp and burpsuite we intercept the initial request when we hit `track car` and we can see that `user id` `5` is being tracked and that its a `websocket` connection. We canmanipulate this message and change the `user id` to `8` and we get our first flag. 

Now lets intercept the `message`. Once we send a message on the web app we can see it shows up as a `websocket` connection on `burpsuite` along with the message we typed and the `user id` lets change the user id from `5` to `8` and thus we get the second flag also.
